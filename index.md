Hello! I am Aparna, a Postdoc specializing in Federated Learning at Meta. I did my PhD at Purdue University, where I worked on developing Decentralized Federated Learning algorithms for heterogeneous data distributions with Professor Kaushik Roy. In addition, I also explored efficient decentralized learning algorithms designed to reduce computational, memory, and communication overhead.

You can access the list of my publications under [the research page](/research/) and my resume under [the resume page](/resume/).
