Hello! I am Aparna, a PhD student specializing in the field of Machine Learning at Purdue University, where I have the privilege of working under the guidance of Professor Kaushik Roy. My research mainly focuses on developing Decentralized Federated Learning algorithms for heterogeneous data distributions. In addition, I am actively exploring efficient decentralized learning algorithms designed to reduce computational, memory, and communication overhead.

You can access the list of my publications under [the research page](/research/) and my resume under [the resume page](/resume/).
