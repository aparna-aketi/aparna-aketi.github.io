Hello! I am Aparna, a Research Scientist with Privacy Preserving Machine Learning team which establishes state-of-the-art scientific advancements for Metaâ€™s products and systems. I did my PhD at Purdue University, where I worked on developing Decentralized Federated Learning algorithms for heterogeneous data distributions with Professor Kaushik Roy. In addition, I also explored efficient decentralized learning algorithms designed to reduce computational, memory, and communication overhead. My current research interests include on-device learning, model personalization and private evolution.

You can access the list of my publications under [the research page](/research/) and my resume under [the resume page](/resume/).
