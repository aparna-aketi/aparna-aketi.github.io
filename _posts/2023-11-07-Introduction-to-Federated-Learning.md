## Introduction to Federated Learning

The remarkable success of deep learning is mainly attributed to the availability of humongous amounts of data and computing power. Large amounts of data are generated on a daily basis at different devices all over the world which could be used to train powerful deep learning models. Collecting such data for centralized processing is not practical because of communication and privacy constraints. To address this concern, a new interest in developing distributed learning algorithms has emerged. Federated learning is a popular setting in the distributed machine learning paradigm, where the training data is kept locally at the edge devices and a global shared model is learned by aggregating the locally computed updates through a coordinating central server.
